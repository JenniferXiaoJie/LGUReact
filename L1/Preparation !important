Welcome to the very beginning of the Web & React Course!
Before you go to the first lecture, I hope you have done the following tasks:
  1. Download and install Chrome: https://www.google.cn/chrome/
    This is a very useful and powerful browser! It is fast, and it is powerful when debugging your website. Although you may be more  familiar with others like Edge or Safari, I strongly recommend you to use this one when programming. And all demos will be conducted on Chrome.
   2. Download and install Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
    This is another very powerful tool for programming! It will make your programming more efficient. And it is compulsory for this course!
    If you are interested, you may look for some tutorials of it. (It is fine to Baidu "vscode 中文文档".) I will show some basic usage during the lecture.
   3. You may preview the PPT before the lecrure (optional.)
   4. Remember to bring your laptop to the classroom on Saturday!

See you~
